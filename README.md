The dataset consists of tweets related to London Olympics. The project analyses this data in three Modules:
1. Text Analysis    - to study the distribution of the length of the tweets.
2. Time Analysis    - to study the distribution of number of tweets posted over a period of time.
3. Hashtag Analysis - to study the number of supporters for each country participating in the Olympics.
